# Web Application Train Scheduler

The project consists of a web application aimed at simplifying and
improving the experience of train travel. The main functionalities
of the application include user registration, train route search,
viewing route details (map, price, stations), ticket purchase,
selecting the desired wagon and seat through a graphical
interface, online payment with a card, and viewing the history of
purchased tickets.
In developing the project, I used Spring Boot for the backend,
Angular for the frontend, and MySQL for data management.
